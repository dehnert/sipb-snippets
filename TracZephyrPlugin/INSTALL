To install the TracZephyrPlugin, first run

  $ python setup.py bdist_egg

then copy the .egg file in the dist/ directory into the plugins/ directory of
your trac install.

To enable the plugin, you must configure the class that zephyr updates should
go to. To do this, add a section like the following to your trac.ini:

  [ZephyrPlugin]
  class = debathena

Then be sure to restart the FastCGI processes if there are any.
