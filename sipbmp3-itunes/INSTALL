iTunes -> sipbmp3
-----------------
This is a simple little script which sends
music from an iTunes library to the sipbmp3
lpr server.

* Changelog
23 Aug 2009 -> broder spun loop into shell script instead of
    applescript so that iTunes doesn't hang
9 Jan 2009 -> price added 'quoted form'
7 Jan 2009 -> kmill created initial version

* System Requirements
This script will only work under Mac OS X as
it uses AppleScript.

* Installation
There are two parts:

1) Launch the Printer Setup Utility and add
   an IP Printer with the LPD protocol with
   the following information:
    Address: zygorthian-space-raiders.mit.edu
    Queue: sipbmp3
   It is not necessary to specify the driver.

2) Create the directory ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts
   and place the "Send to sipbmp3.scpt" file
   within.

* Usage
When in iTunes, select the songs which you
would like to hear in the office, and click
"Send to sipbmp3" in the script menu from
the menu bar.  The script menu looks like a
little scroll icon.  There will be no
feedback beyond the pleasant sounds you now
hear around you.

* Todo
As it is, there is no feedback, even in the
event of failure.  This is decidedly not
optimal.

* And so...
Do whatever you want with it.  I'd like to
have a copy if you extend it.
