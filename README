This is a repository for useful small snippets that really belong in version
control in a central spot, instead of someone's Public. Please add stuff
here via git:

add git
git clone /mit/snippets
cd snippets
[create or copy a file, let's call it "item"]
git commit item
git push

If you're not on gsipb and want to commit, ask e.g. geofft for access. You
can't write to the top level checkout here, but if you push (to the master
branch) from your own checkout, it will automatically update this checkout.

There's a (currently very simple) web interface at
http://snippets.scripts.mit.edu/
