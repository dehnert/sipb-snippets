This is a repository for useful small snippets that really belong in version
control in a central spot, instead of someone's Public. Please add stuff
here via git:

add git
git clone /mit/snippets
cd snippets
[create or copy a file, let's call it "item"]
git commit item
git push

If you're not on gsipb and want to commit, ask geofft (or someone on
sipb-acl) to add you to snippets-committers. You can't write to
/mit/snippets directly, but if you push (to the master branch) from your
own checkout, it will automatically update this checkout.

There's a (currently very simple) web interface at
http://snippets.scripts.mit.edu/

snippets has support for submodules, if things outgrow this repository.
You can use 'git submodule update --init' to populate them if you want,
or look at .gitmodules to find where they live now.
