kdo is a series of shell functions for dealing with multiple Kerberos
on Mac OS X.

Add the contents of bashrc to your .bashrc file. To run a command with
a different set of credentials from your default, run (e.g.)

  kdo broder/root aklog

If you don't currently have credentials for the principal you specify,
you'll be prompted for the password.

kdo by default gets nonforwardable tickets with a 15 minute lifetime,
renewable for 60 minutes; you can change the kinit_args variable in
kdo if you want to change these defaults.

kdo doesn't behave well if you don't already have tickets of some
form.

This snippet also provides krootssh, which is a convenience function
for using your root instance tickets to ssh into another machine.
